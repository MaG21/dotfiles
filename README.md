vimrc
=====
This is my vimrc file, I always try to keep it as much simple as I can while
keeping a feature full vim environment.

In order to automate the installation process, one could execute the setup
script to download and install the necessary plugins on a unix-like
environment.

run:
`$ bash setup.sh`

to install plugins automatically.

The following vim plugins will be installed by the script:
   * Pathogen
   * vim-airline
   * ctrlp.vim
